% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.

% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest

% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of

%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Preliminaries}
 The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) has
attracted much attention during the last few years due to its
wide applications in real life. Since CARP is NP-hard and exact
methods are only applicable to small instances, heuristic and
metaheuristic methods are widely adopted when solving CARP[1]
In this project, I used Genetic Algorithm to solve this NP-hard 
problem
\subsection{Software}
  In this project, I used Pycharm mainly and Sublime Text 3 cosmetically.
I wrote this project in Python3.

\subsection{Algorithm}
   I used genetic algorithm to solve this problem. At first, I used Path-Scanning 
algorithm to get some initial results. I wrote 5 rules to decide which edge should be chosen 
when some edges has the same distance from my current position. The I wrote 5 operators to make 
crossover and mutation of the initial results. I choose about 300 optimal results every time and 
continue mutation until time over.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}

% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Representation}
There are several variables in my python file.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{args}: Lists of command-line arguments

\item \textbf{co}: NumPy 2D adjacent matrix 

\item \textbf{required\_{edges\_{num}}}: Number of required edges 

\item \textbf{vertices\_{num}}: Number of vertices 

\item \textbf{depot\_{num}}: Depot of this dataset

\item \textbf{capacity}: Capacity of each vehicle
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Architecture}
There are also several methods in my file.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{floyd}: Using Floyd algorithm to calculate distances between points and points

\item \textbf{path\_{scanning}}: To produce initial solutions of this problem

\item \textbf{better}: Choose edge when multiple edges are equal distances from the current point using following 5 rules
\begin{itemize}
\item  maximize the distance from the task to the depot;
\item  minimize the distance from the task to the depot;
\item maximize the term dem(t)/sc(t), where dem(t) and sc(t) are demand and serving cost of task t, respectively; 
\item minimize the term dem(t)/sc(t);
\item use rule 1) if the vehicle is less than half-full, otherwise use rule 2)
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{select}: Select the 300 optimal routes.

\item \textbf{print\_{list}}: Print the routes in given format

\item \textbf{cal\_{path\_{cost}}}: Calculate the cost of a route

\item \textbf{check\_{route}}: check if the route is legal

\item \textbf{swap}

\item \textbf{2opt}

\item \textbf{better 2opt}

\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{solve\_{CARP}}: Calculate the cost of a route
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detail of Algorithm}
At first, I use Path-Scanning algorithm to produce initial solution.

\includegraphics[width = .4\textwidth]{pathscanning.png}
\par
Then, I run this methods thousands of times and sort by cost to get initial solutions

\begin{lstlisting}[title=initial-solution, frame=shadowbox]
costList = list()
    for i in range(20):
        costList.append(path_scanning(rt, cost_matrix, 1))
        costList.append(path_scanning(rt, cost_matrix, 2))
    for i in range(200):
        costList.append(path_scanning(rt, cost_matrix, 3))
        costList.append(path_scanning(rt, cost_matrix, 4))
    costList = select(costList, 300)
    for i in range(2500):
        costList.append(path_scanning(rt, cost_matrix, 5))
    costList = select(costList, 300)
\end{lstlisting}

Next, I use mutation method to change the initial solutions to get better solution.

\begin{lstlisting}[title=mutation, frame=shadowbox]
def mutation(cost_matrix, paths):
    rule = random.randint(1, 5)
    if rule == 1:
        return single_insertion(cost_matrix, paths)
    if rule == 2:
        return double_insertion(cost_matrix, paths)
    if rule == 3:
        return swap(cost_matrix, paths)
    if rule == 4:
        return _2opt(cost_matrix, paths)
    if rule == 5:
        return better_2opt(cost_matrix, paths)
\end{lstlisting}
\par 
\newpage
\begin{lstlisting}[title=mutation-main, frame=shadowbox]
 for i in range(0, len(costList) - 1):
            tm = mutation(cost_matrix, costList[i])
            if tm:
                costList.extend(tm)
            # print(costList)
        costList = select(costList, 250)
\end{lstlisting}

Before each mutation, I will check whether the population is mature or not.
If it have matured, I will use 2opt method and better 2opt method to jump out of 
the convergence state! 

\begin{lstlisting}[title=check-mature-main, frame=shadowbox]
  if sum(costList[0][1]) == sum(costList[int((len(costList) - 1) * 0.9)][1]):
            costList = select(costList, 20)
            for i in range(0, len(costList) - 1):
                tm = better_2opt(cost_matrix, costList[i])
                if tm:
                    costList.extend(tm)
                tm = _2opt(cost_matrix, costList[i])
                if tm:
                    costList.extend(tm)
\end{lstlisting}

After that, I will sort the population by cost and print the least cost route.

What's more, I use multiprocessing in this project. I run 8 times at the same time. Then I choose the best solution to print.

\begin{lstlisting}[title=multiprocessing-main, frame=shadowbox]
 worker = []
    worker_num = 8
    seed = int(sys.argv[5])
    create_worker(worker_num)
    Task = [seed + i + random.randint(60, 300) for i in range(0, 24, 3)]  
    # print('Task', Task)
    for i, t in enumerate(Task):
        worker[i % worker_num].inQ.put(t)  
    result = []
    for i, t in enumerate(Task):
        result.append(worker[i % worker_num].outQ.get())  
    result = sorted(result, key=lambda x: sum(x[1]))
    print_list(result[0])
    # print_list(result[7])
    finish_worker()
\end{lstlisting}
 

\section{Empirical Verification}


\subsection{Design}
 Since CARP is NP-hard and exact
methods are only applicable to small instances, heuristic and
metaheuristic methods are widely adopted when solving CARP.[1]

\subsection{Data and data structure}
Data: Data is the 7 given datasets. For example, "gdb10.dat", "egl-s1-A.dat", "egl-e1-A.dat", "val7A.dat", "val4A.dat" and so on.
\par Data Structure: I used list, 2D NumPy matrix, dict, tuple and so on.
\subsection{Performance}
The time complexity is O(n3) and it mainly results from floyd algorithm.

\subsection{Result}
I got a good result in CARP OJ system and this is my results.

\subsection{Analysis}
This project is an application of genetic algorithm. Through this project, I have a better understanding of genetic algorithm and I gained a lot by reading relative papers.
